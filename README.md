# ATS-P2: A GARCH Forecasting Model to Predict Electricity Prices

# Background
--- Final project for ATS in which electricity price data was collected from the California & Spain market. The purpose of the project was to create the best forecasting
    model. While ARIMA was taught in class it handes volatile data poorly and takes too much computing power instead GARCH was used along with bootstrapping to help 
    create a more optimal forecast model.
    
# .csv
--- 4 Excel files that contain the collected electricity prices from California and Spain. Manipulating the data through R is required. 

# .docx --Click on view raw to download and see the markdown version of the code.
--- Rmarkdown was used to convert the file and be able to see the code and graphs together.

# .docx
-- This is the completed final project.

# .Rmd
--- RMD file that contains all code used in Rstudio to create this project.
--- CAUTION: Using ARIMA to model the data takes alot of computing power, it may take 2-5 minutes to run that part of the code.
